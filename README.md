# TaskBoard-App
This is an interactive Project Management App
This mini-project involves building a front-end focused interactive project management application using jQuery, HTML, CSS, and client-side storage technologies. The app will enable users to organize and manage their projects efficiently.

# User Stories

As a user, I wish to add new projects with details like name, type, and due date.


As a user, I want to have the ability to drag and drop projects between different statuses (e.g., To-do, In Progress, Done).


As a user, I want to delete my projects.



# Acceptance Criteria
